# Entrepenator
An open source and free network/ platform for projects from idea to deployment and income. Each project "owns itself". While the protocoll is free and not for profite, the hosted projects can be for profit. Anyone can start projects.

## Project goals
Give power to developers (and optionally to the backers and idea givers).

All profits go to the developers based on their contribution, and optionally to backers and idea givers.

People can work and collaborate on projects and get paid for their efforts, without working for a corporation ("man in the middle"). Give the power back to developers and optionally to investors. Developers invest in a project by working on it.

If you have a grat idea, you do not need to go through all the hassle of starting and managing a company. Instead, you can start a project and set rules that secure your part of the projects profits (e.g., 5% of all profits goes to the idea giver). 

- *Have no accountant, no layers, no bosses.*
- *Work when you want, where you want, how much you want, on what you want and what you believe in.*

### Technologies
- **Contracts** (voting and distribution of potential profits): Etherum
- **Payment**: Etherum

**Frontend**: Angular 2/ Typescript / HTML / SCSS

**"Backend"**: Etherum / Solidity

### Service providers
a service provider can be: 
- server to run the code on
- server to host the HTML
- domain provider
- database provider
- USD to ETH instant payment provider (coinbase/bitpay)
- deployment providers (AWS, Apple Store, Google Play)
- marketing (advertising companies)
- advisors / developers (field experts, code experts, etc.)
- continues integration (test runners)

Service providers can be payed permanent amount or it can be payed a percentage of the total income (god for marketing for instance).

### Release pack
Hash of this is used when proposing a relese.
- release binary (code, deplyment scripts etc)
- contribution list

### Payment pack
Used to pay service providers etc.
- a list of payments

## Process
1. create project
2. (optionally) registrer in the project register
3. work on project anyware (for instance GitHub)
4. someone with propose release pack
5. vote on release (based on number of tokens)
if accepted:
6. contributes get new tokens based on their contributions
7. the relese binary is sent to to plugin providers. They validate the relese pack against the currently accepted relese(hash). And runs their deployment script


## Tokens
Each project has its own token. Tokens are used for voting wight and for distrubuting project profits.

Tokens are erned by contributing and can also be bought. On every new release all contributors have to have the same amount of total contrigutions or more. The differanse from last relese is payed out.

Restrictions on token can be set when a project is started. For instance:
- 10% of tokens should always be owned by project creator
- max 45% of tokens can be owned by investors at any given time (can be sold)

Token price is set by proposing a price then voting on it.

With the rules set above and 45% of tokens sold, investors would have to wait for contributors to earn more tokens before more tokens can be sold. In this case total amount of sold tokens must always be below 45% of all tokens.

## Finances
All earnings from service providers and/or directly gets paid to the project address.

No one in the project has diret controll over funds, domain name etc. All is managed through ethereum and plugin providers.

Payout rules are set when a project is created. Payout is always based on the amount of tokens owned.

## Registry
Projects can be totally private or register in the project registry. In the registry projects can have a discription and URL to attract investors.

## Voting
Voting rules must be public and always based on amount of tokens owned.
