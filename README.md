# Entrepenator
An open source network/ platform for projects from idea to deployment and income. Each project "owns itself".

### Technologies
Code versioning: git
Storage: IPFS
Contracts (voting and distribution of potential profits): Etherum
Payment: Bitcoin

Development language: Go

## Process
 1.  Someone starts a project:
      - explain their idea
      - set voting rules (who decides what is merged etc.)
      - set profit distribution rules
      - how is the MVP accepted
      - what happens after the MVP

 2. (optional) People can put Bitcoin on the idea. For buying plugins.

 3. People can start working on the idea: 
      - discussion 
      - creating task 
 
 4. Developers can start to work on the project.

 5. Deployment scripts are created.

 6. When the MVP is done there should be a product in some store, on the web or other. Through a plugin.

The money earned is distributed based on the rules set at the start of the project and on voting (if allowed in the project definition).

The profits can for instance go:
- back to the project, 
- to the ide giver, 
- to the backers  
- to the developers (based on contribution)
- to some charity

## Project Definition
Explains the idea and rules (and how the rules can be changed) for the project.
For instance, before the MVP the idea giver decides what is merged and after the MVP the ide giver, backers, and developers decide what happens by voting.


## Plugins
All plugins must use bitcoin as payment and payouts. Payments and payouts come from the wallets controlled by the project.
Some example plugins:
- deployment providers (AWS, Apple Store, Google Play)
- marketing (advertising companies)
- advisors / developers (field experts, code experts, etc.)
- continues integration (test runners)
